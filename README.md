# 💫 About Me:
👋 About Me<br><br>Hey! I’m Tenzo, just an 8th grader who’s into coding more than studying (yeah, I said it). I mess around with C# and C++ a lot, making projects that are fun and useful. Some of my stuff includes Mouse and Keyboard Optimizer and Thunder Virus Remover—both cool in their own ways. 🎮💻<br><br>I’m all about trying new things, whether it’s building memory tools, working with UIs, or tweaking things to make them run better. Coding is basically my way of staying productive while still having fun.<br>
