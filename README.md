Hey, I'm Tenzo â€“ nice to meet you all! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my GitHub profile! Iâ€™m super into coding and tech right now, and Iâ€™m always learning and experimenting with new tools and projects.

Iâ€™m currently focusing on C# but also exploring C++ and Python. Iâ€™ve been working on some projects using WinForms, GitHub Actions, and Guna UI. Right now, Iâ€™m working on developing a project with features, like memory manipulation and DLL injection. I also like trying out tools like EasyHook and Reloaded.Injector for my work.

I'm in 8th grade and love coding, though Iâ€™ll admit, studying isn't my favorite thing. ðŸ˜Š I really enjoy creating tools that make things more efficient and more fun!
