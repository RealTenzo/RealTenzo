# Hey, I'm **Tenzo** – nice to meet you all! 👋

Thanks for checking out my GitHub profile! I’m passionate about coding and tech, and I’m always learning, experimenting, and building cool things with new tools and projects.

Currently, I’m diving deep into **C#**, but I’m also exploring **C++** and **Python**. I’ve been working on some interesting projects using **WinForms**, **GitHub Actions**, and **Guna UI**. Right now, I’m developing a project with features like **memory manipulation** and **DLL injection**. I love experimenting with tools like **EasyHook** and **Reloaded.Injector** to make things work even better.

I’m in 8th grade and while I’m totally hooked on coding, I’ll be honest – studying isn't my favorite thing. 😊 But I enjoy building tools that make life more efficient and add a bit of fun along the way!

### 🏆 Finished Projects:
- **NITRO GEN USING PYTHON**  
- **DLL INJECTOR USING C#**

### 🛠️ Skills & Tools:
- **Languages**: C#, C++, Python, Batch
- **Frameworks**: WinForms, Guna UI
